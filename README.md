# Country list

In this test, instead of React, I used htmx.

I use `htmx` to summitting `POST` request with data to *travorblades* API.
Then I use `client-side-templete` extension of htmx and use `handlebars` as templete engine, to parse JSON response to HTML element.


## Build step

No build step require, because `htmx`, `client-side-templete`, and `handlebars` are all use CDN.
